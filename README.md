Fist class is the Director class which is the main runner for this program. It is the base class that decides how many points to give or take away, it also decides
if you are still playing.The Start game function is what is actually staring the game and checking if the game is working properly. The Maingame is where you are able to 
use the H/L inputs from the user. It has conditions or both if you win and lose both with lines of code that add or take away points as needed, it also shows that if you 
guess H/L and get it wrong and end up at 0 it will end the game. The Gamecheck is where you end the game and shows your score while asking if you want to continue
playing the game. 

The card file is pretty simple it just retrieves a random card in the range of 1-13 for each card in the deck that has a value. this class is used in the director.cs
The last file to go over is the program.cs file which basically starts the game the correct way and makes it all run.
